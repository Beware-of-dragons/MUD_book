## About the Book

"Beware of Dragons" is a comprehensive guide that takes you through the journey of creating an immersive multiplayer text adventure game using Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this book provides valuable insights into game development, distributed systems, and best practices. In time, I hope it becomes a community-driven effort to provide a new learning resource to pick up Phoenix/LiveView and good practices in distributed systems.

## Contents

The book is organized into chapters, each focusing on different aspects of game development, from lore creation to designing distributed systems. The book's contents are in the [Table of Contents](/table-of-contents.md). As the book is currently *very early* in its development phase, don't be alarmed if the table of contents were to change (new additions, removing chapters/sections, modifying the structure, and such).
