# Eclipsian Covenant

Philosophy: The Eclipsian Covenant is a secretive and enigmatic faction that worships the ancient King, a mythical being believed to have the power to reshape the world. They are dedicated to awakening the King and ushering in a new era under his rule, with Shadowweaving as their primary source of magic.

Origins: The Covenant's roots trace back to a splinter group of mages and scholars who delved into forbidden magic. Over the centuries, they have grown in numbers and power, their ranks swelling with those drawn to the allure of darkness.

Headquarters: The Covenant operates from hidden fortresses known as "Eclipsian Bastions," shrouded in perpetual darkness. These fortresses serve as both training grounds and centers for dark rituals.

Magic: Members of the Covenant are adept Shadowweavers, harnessing the power of shadows and darkness. They use this magic for various purposes, from concealment and manipulation to offensive spells.

Relations: The Covenant is mistrusted and feared by both the Order and the Vanguard. Their ambitions to awaken the King threaten the balance of power in the world, leading to conflicts and covert operations against their rivals.
