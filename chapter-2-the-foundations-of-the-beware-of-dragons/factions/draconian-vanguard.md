# Draconian Vanguard

Philosophy: The Draconian Vanguard is a small but dedicated faction that venerates dragons as sacred beings. They are sworn to defend these creatures against harm and exploitation, even if it means opposing the Covenant and the Order.

Origins: The Vanguard's origins can be traced to a legendary hero who formed a bond with a dragon and vowed to protect their kind. Over time, more champions have joined their cause, seeking to become dragon guardians.

Headquarters: The Dragon's Roost, hidden within a dormant volcano, serves as the Vanguard's sanctuary. It is a place where humans and dragons coexist in harmony, fostering a unique bond between the two species.

Dragon Bonding: Members of the Vanguard undergo a ritual that allows them to communicate with dragons and gain dragon-like attributes by bathing in dragon blood.

Relations: The Vanguard has a strained relationship with the Covenant and the Order, as they frequently interfere with efforts to control or harm dragons. They are respected by those who revere these creatures.
