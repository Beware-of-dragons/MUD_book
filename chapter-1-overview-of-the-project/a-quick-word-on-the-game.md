# A quick word on the game

Set in the enigmatic realm of the Nexus, players step into the shoes of a fallen warrior resurrected by the deity Revelar to exact revenge. The world of Beware of Dragons is filled with breathtaking landscapes, formidable foes, and intriguing characters.

The game's core mechanics revolve around tactical and challenging combat. Beware of Dragons is rooted in the genre of Souls-like games, where precision, timing, and strategy are paramount. A unique time-limited decision-making system keeps players on their toes, requiring quick choices in the face of danger. Elixirs, equipment, techniques, and special abilities define the depth of combat possibilities.

A central element of the game is mastering the mystical Codex of Draconic Ascendancy, a book of ancient dragon knowledge. Players choose their path as a Dragonling Summoner, Dragon Knight, or Dragon Shifter, each with unique strengths and abilities. As they delve deeper into the Codex, they unlock god-like powers, making them formidable forces in the Nexus.
