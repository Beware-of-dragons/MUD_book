# Aura Welding - a radiant arsenal

As players delve into the art of Aura Welding within Beware of Dragons, they discover its dual nature as both a healing balm and a radiant weapon. The synergy between offense and defense within this magical tradition offers a unique playstyle, where Phenixian Sages become versatile warriors, balancing the forces of light and shadow in the perilous journey through Echovale.

* _Blade of Brilliance:_ The Luminous Blades, when wielded skillfully, become instruments of dazzling brilliance, capable of both physical and radiant damage.

**Aegis of Illumination**

* _Radiant Shielding:_ Aura Welding enables the creation of protective barriers, forming an Aegis of Illumination that wards against physical and magical assaults.
