# Shadow Weaving: perilous arcane arts

Shadow Weaving in Beware of Dragons represents a dance with the shadows, a delicate interplay between concealment and revelation, deception, and outright assault. Players embracing this arcane tradition tread a perilous path, wielding the essence of darkness to reshape the destiny of Echovale.

**Abyssal Bolt**

* _Darkened Projectiles:_ Shadow Weaving enables the creation of Abyssal Bolts, projectiles infused with the essence of the abyss, dealing shadow damage to targets.
* _Corrosive Affliction:_ Successful hits from Abyssal Bolts may afflict targets with a corrosive shadow, reducing their defenses over time.

**Nightshade Veil**

* _Cloak of Shadows:_ Adept Shadow Weavers can weave a Nightshade Veil, shrouding themselves in an ephemeral cloak that grants invisibility and eludes enemies' senses.
* _Deceptive Ambush:_ Under the Nightshade Veil, strategic ambushes become second nature, allowing Shadow Weaver Lords to strike from the shadows with enhanced damage.

**Soul Siphon**

* _Essence Draining:_ Shadow Weaver Lords can employ Soul Siphon, a technique that drains the life force of adversaries, weakening them while fortifying the weaver.
* _Empowered Shadows:_ Successful Soul Siphons empower the shadows around the weaver, enhancing subsequent Shadow Weaving abilities.
