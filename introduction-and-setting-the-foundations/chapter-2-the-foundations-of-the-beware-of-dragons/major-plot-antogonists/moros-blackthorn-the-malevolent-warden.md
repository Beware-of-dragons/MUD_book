# Moros Blackthorn: The Malevolent Warden

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image0_0-6.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In a bygone era, Moros Blackthorn was revered as the guardian of sacred crypts within the realm of Echovale. Clad in obsidian armor adorned with ancient runes, he stood as a noble protector, entrusted with the solemn duty of safeguarding the secrets enshrined within the crypts. His eyes, once filled with a noble purpose, reflected the essence of a devoted guardian.

However, the allure of forbidden knowledge and the shadows that clung to the crypts proved Moros's undoing. As whispers of arcane secrets echoed within the crypt's depths, a seed of temptation took root in his heart. Drawn by a thirst for power and a desire to transcend the boundaries of his mortal existence, Moros succumbed to the forbidden arts that lay dormant for centuries.

The Malevolent Warden wields a claymore infused with shadows, a weapon that devours light and life with each malevolent swing. The whispers of the void intertwine with the ethereal runes etched into his armor, creating a sinister symphony that accompanies his every movement. A small drake, shadowy and elusive, hovers at his sideâ€”an ephemeral companion born of a dark pact, luring adversaries into the Malevolent Warden's strategic traps.

Moros Blackthorn's Umbral Swiftness grants him uncanny agility, his movements a dance through the shadows that disorient and confound his foes. With each Crescent Eclipse, his claymore becomes a conduit for concentrated shade, rending both armor and resolve with devastating strikes. The drake, a manifestation of his evil will, tempts and distracts, forcing adversaries into the calculated web of the Malevolent Warden's strategy.

Driven by a thirst for power and a desire to prove the dominance of shadow over light, Moros Blackthorn's legacy is one of darkness and echoes. Banished from his sacred duty, he embraced the forbidden arts, forsaking his role as protector to become a harbinger of malevolence. Cryptic lore and ominous tales weave the tale of his descent, cautioning those who dare to explore the boundaries of the arcane within Echovale.
