The Nexus, a spectral realm birthed from the very fabric of Revelar's twisted mastery over shadows, emerges as a purgatorial crucible. It captures the souls of those tragically ripped from the mortal realm, ensnaring them in a labyrinthine tapestry of eerie landscapes and formidable trials. Shrouded in ethereal mists and guarded by otherworldly sentinels, this sinister dimension beckons the departed to prove their mettle. Conquer the enigmatic challenges within, and the soul gains an opportunity to wield the Codex of Draconic Ascendancy, while Revelar's malevolent gaze lingers, craving the corrupting touch of its power.
