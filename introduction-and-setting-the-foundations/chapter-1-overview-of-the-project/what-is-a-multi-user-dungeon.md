**What is a multi-user dungeon?**

A MUD game is an online text-based multiplayer game. It allows multiple players to interact and play within a virtual world. They were the predecessors of given MMORPGs, and some are still operating from the 90s, such as [Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands](https://www.achaea.com).

**Usual features in MUD games**

1. Players interact with the game through a text-based interface. With a given set of commands, players can navigate on the map, speak to NPCs, put on equipment, or attack a monster. The server processes these commands and provides textual responses, updating the game state accordingly.
2. MUDs often foster solid online communities, with players forming alliances. The communication aspect is central, as players can chat, form groups, and engage in role-playing interactions.
3. MUDs often emphasize role-playing and character customization. Players can create and control characters with unique attributes, abilities, and personalities.

Overall, MUD game servers provide a unique and immersive multiplayer gaming experience through text-based interaction and user-driven content. While they may lack the graphical richness of modern 3D MMORPGs, they offer a rich and creative environment where players can engage in storytelling, exploration, and social interaction.
